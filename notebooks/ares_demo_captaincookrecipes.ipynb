A kinetic energy cutoff of 40 Ry for the wave function and of 240 Ry for the density together with a (10 × 10 × 12) Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid were used in geometry optimization; a (12 × 12 × 16) k-point grid was instead used for density of states calculations. Since IrO2 is a metal, we applied the Marzari-Vanderbilt cold smearing (22) of 0.02 Ry to the computed eigenvalues so as to improve the k-point convergence of our calculations.\n",
      " 2. We mentioned already the different demands for sampling density in semiconducting vs. metallic systems. Even if a material is semiconducting in the bulk, it may possess surface or interface states that are metallic.\n",
      " 3. Interestingly, transition metals require more k-points in general, independently from being part of a metallic (Fig. 6c) or of a non-metallic (Fig. 6d) system.\n",
      " 4. A baseline k-point mesh of 1000/(number of atoms in the cell) is used for all computations... As mentioned, we currently employ a k-point mesh of 1000 per reciprocal atom (pra).\n",
      " 5. For bulk calculations, a 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst-Pack grid of k-points [24] was chosen.\n",
      " 6. Metallic systems require accurate Fermi surface sampling, which necessitates denser k-point grids compared to insulators with band gaps\n",
      " 7. The tetragonal symmetry of rutile (space group P42/mnm) with c/a ≈ 0.64 suggests anisotropic electronic structure requiring different k-point densities along different directions\n",
      " 8. The comparison between insulating rutile structures using 4×4×4 grids and metallic IrO2 using 10×10×12 or denser grids demonstrates the inadequacy of 5×5×5 for metallic rutile IrO2\n",
      " 9. Based on convergence studies showing that metals require k-point densities sufficient to achieve <1 meV/atom accuracy, a 5×5×5 grid for metallic IrO2 would likely produce errors exceeding acceptable thresholds\n",
